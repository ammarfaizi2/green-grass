			<h3>Key Partners</h3>
			<p>We have farmers as key partners. Farmers have thecritical point for our business. Without them our business can't run.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="cdesc">
			<h3>Revenue Streams</h3>
			<p>Our revenue streams will be dynamic pricing, because every single item has its own price. So our revenue completely depends on how much an item is sold.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="cdesc">
			<h3>Cost Structure</h3>
			<p>Our business is cost driven, because we need to gather the resources at the beginning of steps. This takes a lot of money and to build trust between us and farmers, we need to assure that we have enough funding to continue distribute their vegetables, fruits, etc.</p>
